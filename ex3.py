#### Math Operators


#% gives you the remainder. also if 3%4, then remainder is 3
# also, % before all in order of operations

#if all ints, then py assumes no floating point (decimal)
# 1/4 = 0, 1.0/4 = 0.25

# also no parens needed in simple math???
# 3 + 2< 5-7 does the correct math and returns False

print " I will now count my chickens"

print "Hens", 25 + 30/6
print "Roosters", 100-25*3 %4

print " now i will cout my eggs:"

print 3 + 2 + 1 -5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

print "is it true that 3+2 < 5 - 7?"
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

print "what is 3 + 2", 3 + 2
print " what is 5-7,", 5-7

print " oh that's why thats false"

print " is it greater?", 5 >-2

print " is it greater or equal?", 5 >=-2
